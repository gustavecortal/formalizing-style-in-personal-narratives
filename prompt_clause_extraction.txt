An English clause is a group of words that contains at least a subject and a predicate. Clauses are fundamental building blocks of sentences. They can be categorized into two main types: dependent clauses and independent clauses.

### Independent Clauses

An independent clause, also known as a main clause, can stand alone as a complete sentence. It expresses a complete thought and has both a subject and a predicate.

**Examples:**
- "She enjoys reading."
- "The sun is shining brightly."

### Dependent Clauses

A dependent clause, also known as a subordinate clause, cannot stand alone as a complete sentence. It does not express a complete thought and depends on an independent clause to give it meaning. Dependent clauses also contain a subject and a predicate, but they begin with subordinating conjunctions or relative pronouns.

**Examples:**
- "Because she enjoys reading"
- "Although the sun is shining brightly"

A clause always has a predicate. If there is no predicate, then it is not a clause !

### Types of Sentences

Understanding the types of clauses helps in constructing different types of sentences: simple, complex, compound, and compound-complex sentences.

#### Simple Sentences

A simple sentence consists of a single independent clause. It may have a compound subject or verb but still contains only one clause.

**Examples:**
- "The cat slept."
- "Tom and Jerry are best friends."

#### Complex Sentences

A complex sentence contains one independent clause and at least one dependent clause. The dependent clause can function as an adjective, adverb, or noun within the sentence.

**Examples:**
- "When the bell rang, the students left the classroom."
- "She decided to take a nap because she was tired."

#### Compound Sentences

A compound sentence consists of two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) or a semicolon.

**Examples:**
- "I wanted to go for a walk, but it started to rain."
- "She loves to read; he prefers to watch movies."

#### Compound-Complex Sentences

A compound-complex sentence has at least two independent clauses and at least one dependent clause. This type of sentence combines elements of both compound and complex sentences.

**Examples:**
- "Although I was tired, I finished my homework, and I went to bed early."
- "She didnâ€™t see the movie because she was busy, but she heard it was good."

Remember, a clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a predicate. The subject typically performs the action or is described by the predicate. The predicate, which is the core of the clause, must include a verb and may also contain objects, complements, or adverbial phrases that complete its meaning. The verb within the predicate must agree with the subject in number and sometimes tense, and the entire clause must form a coherent and logically complete idea. A clause can function as a part of a larger sentence or stand alone as a complete sentence. If there is no predicate, then it is not a clause.
